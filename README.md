# NodeJS Express Jest TDD

## Installation
- Create a template: npx express-generator --no-view <project_name>
- Run "jest --watchAll" to rerun the test anytime the code changes

## TDD
- First write your tests that would be failing
- Start implementing util your tests start passing
- Refactor to improve the code
- Write even more tests
- Go in that circle util eventually you end up with a fully implemented application
